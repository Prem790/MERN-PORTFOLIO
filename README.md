Portfolio Website
This project is a full-stack portfolio website engineered using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It demonstrates a sophisticated and dynamic platform where the admin can effortlessly manage content through a dedicated admin panel. The admin panel includes robust functionality for adding, updating, and deleting projects and experiences, all without the necessity of directly modifying the codebase in VS Code.

Key Features:
Dynamic Admin Panel: An advanced interface for content management, providing capabilities to add, update, and delete projects and experiences dynamically.
Admin Authentication: Implemented with JWT for secure and seamless admin authentication, ensuring only authorized users have access to the admin panel.
Responsive Design: Utilizes Tailwind CSS to achieve a fully responsive and aesthetically pleasing design across all devices, enhancing the user experience.
Full-Stack Implementation: Combines the efficiency of React for the frontend, the power of Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and the scalability of MongoDB for the database, ensuring a robust and seamless user experience.
API Integration: Efficient RESTful APIs to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth data transactions and real-time updates.
Technologies Used:
